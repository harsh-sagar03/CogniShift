CogniShift is an AI-powered browser extension designed to revolutionize how neurodiverse students interact with the web. Developed for the Innovate 3.0 Hackathon at JIIT Noida, CogniShift leverages cutting-edge, on-device artificial intelligence to create a personalized, distraction-free, and supportive learning environment.

## The Why (Problem Statement) ❓

The modern web is built for the "neurotypical" brain, often prioritizing engagement through constant stimulation. For **neurodivergent** students, this creates a digital environment full of obstacles:

* **Sensory Overload:** Autoplay videos, flashing banners, and cluttered sidebars compete for limited attention, leading to rapid cognitive fatigue.
* **The "Wall of Text" Effect:** Long, unstructured articles can feel insurmountable, often causing students to abandon research before they even begin.
* **Privacy Paranoia:** Many existing "assistance" tools send sensitive user data to the cloud for processing, creating a barrier for those who are privacy-conscious.

**CogniShift** was born to bridge this gap. By moving the "intelligence" of the web directly onto the user's device, we create a browsing experience that is not just productive, but **inclusive**.
